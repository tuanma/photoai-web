        <h3 class="subsection-title">2.1 Data Usage</h3>
        <p>To the extent practicable, we only use your data in an anonymized, hashed or obfuscated form. We only use personally identifiable information to the extent necessary to provide the Services.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">2.2 Data Disclosure</h3>
        <p>We may share your data with third parties as described in this Privacy Statement. We may disclose your data:</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">2.3 Advertising and Analytics</h3>
        <p>We may use and share data, including automatically collected data and user-provided data, in an anonymized, hashed, or obfuscated form for advertising purposes by us or our partners. We do not pass any personally identifiable data to ad networks or advertisers.</p>
        
        <p>This data may be used to serve ads to users based on the inferred interests of a particular user, or to display ads on third-party apps or other platforms. We work with advertisers and third-party ad companies to collect data about your interactions with ads and content served in the App, which helps us keep the App free.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">2.4 Analytics Companies</h3>
        <p>We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the App is used, such as how often and for how long.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">3.3 Advertising Identifiers</h3>
        <p>Most modern devices offer advertising identifiers. The names of these identifiers vary depending on the brand of your device. For example, on iOS/Apple devices, they are called Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA). These operating systems allow you to view your advertising identifier and control how it is used in your device settings.</p>
        
        <p>The settings include options to change the identifier and opt out of cross-app advertising. The features or functionality here may change at the discretion of the operating system. To opt-out, our advertising partners use data collected from different apps to serve ads tailored to your interests, please consult the settings on your device (e.g., select "Limit Ad Tracking" on your iOS/Apple device).</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">3.4 Opt-out Tools</h3>
